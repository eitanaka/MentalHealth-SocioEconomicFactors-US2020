# Mental Health, Socio-Economic Factors, and Health Risk Behaviors: A Study in the US (2020)
## Description
In our preceding research (project 1), we delved deep into the correlation between health risk behaviors and health outcomes/status. Pivoting from that foundation, this project aims to explore the significant influences on mental health arising from lifestyle choices, socio-economic factors, and the unprecedented events of COVID-19, focusing specifically on the United States. Utilizing census tracts, we intend to compute and analyze multifarious datasets to unearth the determinants that might have critically impacted mental well-being in the year 2020.
